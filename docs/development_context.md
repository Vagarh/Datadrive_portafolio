# Development Context for DataDive Portfolio

This document summarizes the current state of the project, key decisions made, and pending tasks. It is intended to provide a quick context for future development sessions.

## 1. Project Goal

The main objective is to build a modern, professional, and interactive personal portfolio for Juan Felipe, a Data Scientist. The portfolio should showcase his skills, projects, and services, and include AI-powered features to engage visitors. The core vision is defined in `docs/blueprint.md`.

## 2. Current Status (as of our last session)

### Frontend:
- **UI is mostly complete**: All main sections (Hero, About, Projects, Certifications, Contact) are built and styled.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is functional on different screen sizes, with recent fixes to improve mobile video display and remove unnecessary spacing.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Implemented `framer-motion` to create engaging scroll-triggered animations for the Projects and Certifications sections, enhancing the user experience.
- **Skills Section**: Replaced the initial carousel with a more visually appealing grid of badges, with staggered animations and dynamic background colors.
- **Contact Form**: The form UI is in place.

### Backend:
- **Express Server**: The Express server (`backend/server.ts`) has been significantly enhanced.
- **Robust Security**:
    - **CORS**: Configured a strict CORS policy to only allow requests from the frontend's specific domain, improving security.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Implemented `express-rate-limit` to protect the API from abuse and brute-force attacks.
- **Advanced Validation**: Integrated `zod` to create strong validation schemas for all API endpoints, ensuring data integrity.
- **Optimized Development Workflow**: Added a `dev` script using `ts-node-dev` to automatically restart the server on file changes, speeding up development.
- **Functional Endpoints**:
    - `/api/contact`: Receives form data, validates it, and sends an email via the Resend API.
    - `/api/register-cv`: Validates the email, logs it to Firestore, and serves the `cv.pdf` file.

### Documentation:
- **READMEs**: We have generated comprehensive `README.md` files for the root directory and key subdirectories (`src`, `public`, `backend`, `docs`).
- **Development Context**: This file is kept up-to-date with our progress.

## 3. Pending Tasks & Next Steps

Based on our last conversation, here are the most logical next steps to enhance the project:

### Backend Next Steps:
1.  **Persist Contact Messages**: Modify the `/api/contact` endpoint to save a copy of each message to a **Firestore** collection (e.g., `contactMessages`).
2.  **Implement AI Project Recommendations**:
    - Create a new endpoint, e.g., `/api/recommend`.
    - This endpoint will take the user's message text as input.
    - Use **Genkit** (already in the project) to analyze the text and determine the user's area of interest.
    - Return a list of 2-3 relevant projects from `src/lib/portfolio-data.ts`.

### Frontend Next Steps:
1.  **Enhance Contact Form UX**:
    - Add a loading state (e.g., a spinner) while the form is submitting.
    - Display clear success or error messages to the user after submission.
2.  **Integrate AI Recommendations**:
    - After the contact form is successfully submitted, call the new `/api/recommend` endpoint.
    - Use the response to visually highlight the recommended projects in the "Projects" section or display them in a "toast" notification.
3.  **Final Polish**: Conduct a final review of the entire site for any minor UI bugs, accessibility issues, and performance bottlenecks (e.g., image optimization).

## 4. Key Decisions Made

- **Enhanced Backend Security**: Prioritized making the backend more robust by adding validation, rate limiting, and a strict CORS policy.
- **Dynamic Frontend Animations**: Switched from a basic intersection observer to `framer-motion` for smoother and more professional-looking animations.
- **Improved Responsive Design**: Addressed and fixed layout issues on mobile devices to ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Focused on creating and maintaining detailed documentation to streamline future development.
