# Development Context for DataDive Portfolio

This document summarizes the current state of the project, key decisions made, and pending tasks. It is intended to provide a quick context for future development sessions.

## 1. Project Goal

The main objective is to build a modern, professional, and interactive personal portfolio for Juan Felipe, a Data Scientist. The portfolio should showcase his skills, projects, and services, and include AI-powered features to engage visitors. The core vision is defined in `docs/blueprint.md`.

## 2. Current Status (as of our last session)

### Frontend:
- **UI is mostly complete**: All main sections (Hero, About, Projects, Certifications, Contact) are built and styled.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is functional on different screen sizes.
- **Animations**: We've implemented scroll-based animations for sections to fade in.
- **Skills Section**:
    - Replaced the initial carousel with a more visually appealing grid of badges.
    - Implemented a staggered animation for the badges to appear one by one.
    - Added dynamic, high-contrast background colors to each badge, based on the site's color palette.
- **Contact Form**: The form UI is in place.

### Backend:
- **Express Server**: A basic Express server is running (`backend/server.ts`).
- **Contact Form Endpoint**: The `/api/contact` endpoint is functional. It receives form data and sends an email using the Resend API.
- **CV Download Endpoint**: The `/api/register-cv` endpoint logs the email to Firestore and serves the `cv.pdf` file.
- **Environment Variables**: The project is configured to use a `.env` file for API keys and sensitive information.

### Documentation:
- **README.md**: We have created a comprehensive `README.md` file with project features, setup instructions, and technology stack.

## 3. Pending Tasks & Next Steps

Based on our last conversation, here are the most logical next steps to enhance the project:

### Backend Next Steps:
1.  **Persist Contact Messages**: Modify the `/api/contact` endpoint to save a copy of each message to a **Firestore** collection (e.g., `contactMessages`).
2.  **Implement AI Project Recommendations**:
    - Create a new endpoint, e.g., `/api/recommend`.
    - This endpoint will take the user's message text as input.
    - Use **Genkit** (already in the project) to analyze the text and determine the user's area of interest.
    - Return a list of 2-3 relevant projects from `src/lib/portfolio-data.ts`.
3.  **Improve Validation**: Use **Zod** (already a dependency) in the backend to create a more robust validation schema for the incoming request body on all endpoints.

### Frontend Next Steps:
1.  **Enhance Contact Form UX**:
    - Add a loading state (e.g., a spinner) while the form is submitting.
    - Display clear success or error messages to the user after submission.
2.  **Integrate AI Recommendations**:
    - After the contact form is successfully submitted, call the new `/api/recommend` endpoint.
    - Use the response to visually highlight the recommended projects in the "Projects" section or display them in a "toast" notification.
3.  **Final Polish**: Conduct a final review of the entire site for any minor UI bugs, accessibility issues, and performance bottlenecks (e.g., image optimization).

## 4. Key Decisions Made

- **Skills Display**: Switched from a carousel to an animated, multi-colored grid of badges to improve visual impact.
- **Error Resolution**: Solved several build and hydration errors related to `embla-carousel`, module resolution, and environment variables.
- **Documentation**: Decided to create this context file and a detailed `README.md` to properly document the project.
